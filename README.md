A MACHINE LEARNING BASED SECURITY MODEL FOR CLOUD SERVICES
-
In this project, I developed a sophisticated security model leveraging Machine Learning techniques to enhance the protection of cloud services. Implemented entirely in Java, this solution addresses the evolving challenges of data security and access control in cloud environments.

Prerequisites
-
1: Apache NetBeans: Download Apache-NetBeans-13-bin-windows-x64. You can download it from netbeans.apache.org.

2: Java Development Kit (JDK): Download JDK if not already installed. You can download it from the official Oracle website.

#Java Development Kit (JDK): NetBeans requires a JDK to be installed

3: Integrated Development Environment (IDE): This is optional but tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans can simplify your coding and deployment.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
-
Step 1: Install JDK (jdk-8u144-windows-x64).

Step 2: Install Apache-NetBeans-13-bin-windows-x64.

Step 3: After installation launch Apache NetBeans

Step 4: Click the file menu then ->click the open project option ->select the ML.main folder.

Step 5: package installation: To add a package using the library option, right click on “library” and then select “ADD JAR/FOLDER” from the menu

Step 6: select the ML.main folder ->jar file ->Weka-stable-3.6.10

Step 7: After installing the Weka-stable-3.6.10 package, click on “cloud_intru” and then press the “run” button to run the program

Step 8: click browse button to select a directory

Step 9: press desktop->ML.main->input file->NSLKDDdataset.csv

Step 10: open the file

Step 11: Convert numeric data to nominal data

Step 12: Check the information gain ratio of the data

Step 13: Open the dataset.arff to display the average one dependence estimator classifier

Step 14: Click on “Evaluation” to check the accuracy...
